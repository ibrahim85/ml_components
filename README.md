# Reusable Maching Learning Components #

A library of Machine Learning models and algorithms written in Python.

This library goes alongside my Machine Learning demonstration graphical application located at https://github.com/jamalmoir/ml_demo

**IMPLEMENTED**
- Forward Feeding Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network
- Decision Tree trained via the ID3 algorithm

**TODO**
- K-Nearest-Neighbours 
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Regression
- ???

**ROADMAP**
- ~~Develop forward feedining backpropagation Artificial Neural Network~~
- ~~Change Neural Network to use an adaptive learning rate~~
- ~~Add support for saving Neural Networks to and loading them from pre-trained models~~
- ~~Add hyperbolic tangent as a activation function~~
- ~~Develop Decision Tree trained with the ID3 algorithm~~
- ~~Add support for saving Decision Trees to and loading them from pre-trained models~~
- Add support for continuous data to the Decision Tree
- Develop K-Nearest-Neighbours algorithm
