# Reusable Maching Learning Components #

This is a University project titles "Reusable Machine Learning Components". 

The aim of this project is to develop reusable machine learning components in the form of a library and then to create an easy-to-use graphical user interface on top of the library.

The following will be developed:
- Forward feeding back propagation artificial neural network
- Decision tree trained via the ID3 algorithm

Time permitting the following will also be developed:
- Logistic regression
- Linear regression
- K-nearest neighbours
